# How to Host Your Personnel Management System on Railway

## What is Railway?
Railway is like a magic box that takes your website code and puts it on the internet so anyone can visit it. Think of it like uploading a video to YouTube, but for websites.

## Step-by-Step Instructions (Super Simple!)

### Step 1: Get Your Code Ready
âœ… Your code is already ready! I've prepared everything for you.

### Step 2: Create a Railway Account
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Start a New Project"
3. Sign up with your GitHub account (or create one if you don't have it)

### Step 3: Upload Your Code to GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com
2. Click the green "New" button to create a new repository
3. Name it: `personnel-management-system`
4. Make it Public
5. Upload all your project files to this repository

### Step 4: Connect to Railway
1. Back on Railway, click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Connect your GitHub account
3. Select your `personnel-management-system` repository
4. Click "Deploy Now"

### Step 5: Add a Database
1. In your Railway project dashboard, click "New Service"
2. Select "PostgreSQL" 
3. Click "Add PostgreSQL"
4. Wait for it to deploy (takes 1-2 minutes)

### Step 6: That's It!
Railway will automatically:
- Install all your code dependencies
- Connect your database
- Start your website
- Give you a web address (URL)

## What Happens Next?
- Railway gives you a URL like: `your-app-name.railway.app`
- Your website will be live on the internet!
- Anyone can visit it using that URL
- It runs 24/7 automatically

## Important Notes:
- Free plan gives you $5 credit per month (enough for small websites)
- Your website stays online even when you close your computer
- You can update your code anytime by pushing to GitHub

## If Something Goes Wrong:
1. Check the "Deploy Logs" in Railway dashboard
2. Make sure all files were uploaded to GitHub
3. Verify the PostgreSQL service is running

## Your Website Features:
- Main Dashboard: Shows all personnel
- Admin Panel: Add/remove personnel  
- TV Dashboard: Full-screen view for monitoring
- All 22 platforms supported
- Color-coded status alerts
